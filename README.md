# Object-Detection-and-Motion-Tracking



In this Projects I have Implemented Object Detection on images and Object Detection and Tracking on webcam input.

Tech stack used:Python,OpenCv.


## Here is the Demo of Object Detection on images
* First the user has to select the object she/he wants to detect.
* For convenience purpose I have choosen  to detect two seperate objects in an input image.
* Then the user has to give a new image to be examined.
* The Tracker i STATUS section gives an indication about the specific object being detected or not.
